# For each variable below, write a comment with what kind of thing it is (int, float, str, or bool)
number = 7

# Can you change these values to the type shown in the comment?
age = "15"      # Change to int
score = 10      # Change to str
rain = "False"  # Change to bool
height = "1.75" # Change to float

# What will be printed?

# Write your guesses as comments, then run and check

# Make the statements True by filling in the correct type.
