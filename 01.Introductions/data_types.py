# IB DP CompSci - First Class Exercise: Data Types

# Puzzle 1: What am I?
# For each variable below, write a comment with what kind of thing it is (int, float, str, or bool)
number = 7
decimal = 3.5
word = "hello"
is_sunny = True
# Your turn: Add a comment with the type for each variable above!

# Puzzle 2: Change my type!
# Can you change these values to the type shown in the comment?
age = "15"      # Change to int
score = 10      # Change to str
rain = "False"  # Change to bool
height = "1.75" # Change to float
# Write your conversion code below:
# Example: age_int = int(age)

# Puzzle 3: Guess the result!
# What will be printed? Guess before you run!
print(type(2 + 2))
print(type("5" + "5"))
print(type(3.0 + 1))
print(type(True))
# Write your guesses as comments, then run and check!

# Puzzle 4: Fill in the blank!
# Make the statements True by filling in the correct type.
assert isinstance("school", str) == True
assert isinstance(42, ____ ) == True
assert isinstance(2.5, ____ ) == True
assert isinstance(False, ____ ) == True
# Fill in the blanks above!
